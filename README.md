## Introduction
In this project, we perform exploratory data analysis on a dataset containing information about airfare and passenger numbers. The aim is to understand the relationship between these variables and identify key trends and insights.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a CSV file named `Consumer_Airfare_Report_Table.csv`. It contains the following columns:
- `Airfare`: The cost of airfare.
- `Passengers`: The number of passengers.

## Setup
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Praveen0095/Exploratory-data-analysis.git
    cd Exploratory-data-analysis
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Data Exploration
We begin by loading the dataset and performing initial exploration to understand its structure and contents. This includes displaying the first few rows, checking for missing values, and summarizing basic statistics.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
da = pd.read_csv('Consumer_Airfare_Report_Table.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the dataframe
print(da.head(10))

# Check for missing values
print(df.isnull().sum())
